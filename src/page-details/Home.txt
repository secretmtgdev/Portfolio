Hi there, my name is Michael Wilson and I'm currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft. Prior to joining Microsoft I was a Frontend Engineer at Amazon where I spent most of my time developing upon three services in Java. I know, the title at Amazon was a bit of a misnomer. In my spare time I enjoy diving into mathematics and Unity.\n There really isnâ€™t a whole lot to talk about on this page but feel free to navigate to other portions of this site to dive into my journey as a business student to physics student to computer science student to Frontend Engineer to Software Engineer.\n I hope that you find this site helpful.
